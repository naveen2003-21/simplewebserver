<h2>2.R</h2>
R is another emerging name in the Programming world! It is an open-source programming language that is widely used in the area of Data Science, Statistical Analysis, and Machine Learning and provides you with a huge set of libraries and frameworks. The language is very much suitable for GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows. Also, it can be easily integrated with several data processing technologies like Hadoop & Spark. Some of the other prominent features of this particular language such as cross-platform compatibility, highly extensible, strong graphical capabilities, distributed computing, etc. make it a more preferred language among the developers.

And many other programming languages inherit the properties of this particular language. 
On the other hand, C++ is an object-oriented programming language (primarily developed as an extension of C).
 The language is widely used in Game Development, GUI & Desktop applications, and Competitive Programming along with several other fields
  <h2>5.Python</h2>
  Python has been the favorite language of almost every individual who is just starting with the programming domain for the last many years. 
  The primary reason behind this is a quite simple syntax that makes it easy to read, learn, and use. The language is extensively used for web development, software development, etc., and with several trending technologies such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, etc.
  The language offers some enriching features such as rich library support, automatic garbage collection, easier integration with other languages, GUI Programming support, and many more. 
  Several popular Python frameworks that make things more efficient & convenient are Django, Flask, Pyramid, etc.
